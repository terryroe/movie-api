# movie-api

A server-side (Node.js) application to manage `users` and `movies`, and expose the information through an API.

My role in the project was the sole developer. I developed the code and documentation for the project.

I learned that CORS is difficult to get configured correctly, and I'm still trying to get it to work as I expect.

I am looking forward to creating a client application to serve as the user interface to the application.

## App Details

- The app is hosted on Heroku at https://users-movies-f50a18657028.herokuapp.com.
- The API has a number of endpoints which are documented at https://users-movies-f50a18657028.herokuapp.com/documentation.html

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Other supporting npm packages. See `package.json` for details.
